#![no_std]

//! Shared Tholos client import and error mapping for contracts that call into
//! Tholos rather than building their own dispute resolution logic
//! (`demo-consumer` and `asserter-consumer`). Exists so the two consumer
//! example crates don't each carry their own verbatim copy of this: if
//! `tholos::Error` ever gains a variant one of these should surface
//! distinctly, or the mapping logic needs a fix, there's exactly one place to
//! update instead of two that have to be kept in sync by hand.
